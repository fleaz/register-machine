# register-machine

Back in school we once had to give presentations in computer science class. My topic was [register machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_machine) and I decided to build an simulator so my classmates could play around with it and maybe better understand it. So I googled a bit for a good programming language to use (I had no programming experience at that point except for a few weeks of Java at school) and decided to use Python. So I teached myself a bit of Python in a few days and created this masterpiece which I lukily found in an very old backup :D
